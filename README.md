When a large number of content injection requests are received, it can automatically scale out by running multiple Amazon Glue jobs concurrently, ensuring these requests are processed in time.

#### Chunk Metadata
Chunk metadata is defined as below shown:
| Name              | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| chunk_id          | Unique chunk id                                                                  |
| heading_hierarchy | Heading hierarchy which is used to locate the chunk in the whole file content    |
| title             | The heading of current section                                                   |
| level             | Heading level, eg. H1 is #, H2 is ## in markdown                                 |
| parent            | The chunk id of parent section, eg. H2's parent is its H1, H3's parent is its H2 |
| previous          | The chunk id of previous paragraph at the same Level                             |
| child             | The chunk ids of sub sections                                                    |

| size              | The number of the chunks when the paragraph is split by a fixed chunk size       |

Here is an example

```
{
	"file_path": "s3://example/intelli-agent-user-guide.pdf",
	"file_type": "pdf",
	"content_type": "paragragh",
	"current_heading": "# Intelli-Agent User Guide WebApp",
	"chunk_id": "$1-4659f607-1",
	"heading_hierarchy": {
		"title": "Intelli-Agent User Guide",
		"level": 1,
		"parent": null,
		"previous": null,
		"child": [
			"$2-038759db",

```



## **Quick Start**


### **Deployment**

To deploy the solution, follow these steps:

**Step 1**: Clone the GitHub repository

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
```

**Step 2**: Navigate to the deployment directory

```bash
cd deployment
```

**Step 3**: Run the installer script

```bash
# Deploy everything (config + build + deploy)
./installer.sh

# Or run individual steps:
./installer.sh config  # Install dependencies and configure
./installer.sh build   # Build and prepare assets
./installer.sh deploy  # Deploy to AWS
```


### **Updating an Existing Deployment**

You can update an existing deployment following these steps:

**Step 1**: Navigate to the deployment directory

```bash
cd deployment
```

**Step 2**: Adjust the configuration

Rerun `./installer.sh config`, or modify the config.json located under the `source/infrastructure/bin` directory.


**Step 3**: Update the deployment

```bash
# Update everything
./installer.sh

# Or update specific components:
./installer.sh build   # Rebuild assets only
./installer.sh deploy  # Deploy changes only
```

### 📚 **2. CRAFT Document Conversion & Library**
The Document Library provides intelligent document conversion and management capabilities:
- **Supported Formats**: PDF, DOCX, Excel (XLS/XLSX), CSV, HTML, TXT, MD, JSON, JSONL, and image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP)
- **Automatic Conversion**: Documents are automatically converted to Markdown format with preserved structure
- **Image Extraction**: Embedded images and image links are automatically extracted and stored separately
- **UI Upload Limit**: 10MB per document
- **Batch Operations**: Single upload, multiple deletion support

Tips:
- Duplicate document names will be overwritten with the latest version
- Upload Process: Document upload → Conversion to Markdown → Image extraction → Offline processing
- Status shows "Completed" only after both conversion and processing are finished
- Converted Markdown files and extracted images are stored in S3 with organized structure
- Example:

### **RESTful API**
- **Endpoint**: `/process`
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Convert documents (PDF, DOCX, Excel, CSV, HTML) to Markdown with automatic image extraction
- **Input**: S3 bucket and object key of source document

## **FAQ**

### **Environment issues**

Follow below steps if you encounter an environment issue.

**Step 1**: Install the required dependencies

Execute following commands to install dependencies such as Python, Git, npm, docker and create a service linked role for Amazon OpenSearch service. You can skip this step if they are already installed.
The `setup_env.sh` script is adapted for Amazon Linux 2023. If you are using other operating systems, please manually install these dependencies.


```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/sample-craft/refs/heads/main/source/script/setup_env.sh
sh setup_env.sh
```

**Step 2**: Install the AWS CLI 

Execute the following command to install the AWS CLI if it is not installed.

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

Execute the following command to check the AWS CLI version:

```bash
aws --version
```
